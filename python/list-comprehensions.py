Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers X, Y and Z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer .
You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i, j, k) on a 3D grid where the sum of is not equal to .
Here, 0 <= i <= X; 0 <= j <= Y; 0 <= k <= Z

Input Format

Four integers X, Y, Z and N each on four separate lines, respectively.
